## About Project

I implemented a gallery app with a dynamic layout, based on UICollectionView. In the project I included asynchronous work with Unsplash API, persistent storage based on Realm, like features, image sharing, error handling, support for IOS 13 and many more...

Unfortunately, due to time constraints, I wasn't able to implement all the features I intended to build, so I focused on the required ones. But, I attached my journal, so you can see the planning for the project.

I enjoyed building this app, and perhaps I will return to it some day to add more features to my plan.
